# "Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.”

This quote really hits home, because there have been so many cases where I have a “eureka!” moment in the middle of a project. Sometimes, actually beginning a project after brainstorming can give you a better sense of the problem and it’s unique challenges, leading to new realizations. Other times, a new piece of information about the problem can help you improve upon a solution you thought was great, but in reality was only good. I can only hope that the realization comes in the first few commits! 

# "Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.”

I like this quote, because this person’s knowledge of design is on-point. So many times I find a website that is so cluttered with buttons, slides, and other useless components that it in a sense takes away functionality, because it takes me longer to find what I want. A good design is one that you realize has everything it needs, and nothing more. The same is true for code. If you can reach a point where all of your code is essential, there’s less clutter.
