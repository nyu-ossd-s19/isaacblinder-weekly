# My Contributions
For the group project, I had multiple roles:
1) I introduced the team to React and TypeScript, and helped them learn the basic building-blocks of each.
2) I helped pick out issues that looked suitable for a team of our size / skillset.
3) I worked on creating typescript demos with the team.
4) I worked on my own issue, implementing a new feature that was requested. This was the largest issue I undertook, and challenged my react skills and gave me a great amount of experience regarding open source development practices.
