# Week 4 Blog Post
This week's blog includes a project evaluation of the React open source project on Github. I chose this project because it is a popular web development tool that is 
considered on the cutting-edge when it comes to creating a smart UI. It has a lot of interesting features and a large / friendly community. Enjoy!
#

Project Name: React

__Project website:__

https://reactjs.org





__What is the purpose of the project:__

React is designed to make it easier to create a well-designed UI for your website.





__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__

There is a tab on the main nav called “community” which contains some information about contributing, however it did not contain real contribution guidelines or a link to the Github. The actual contribution guide was hidden in the docs.





__Contributing instructions:__

All of the contributions must be done through github. They have a code of conduct and do explain ways to contribute to the main branch. It appears a good way to contribute would be to work on a known bug.



__URL for the code repository:__

https://github.com/facebook/react


__Bug/Issue tracker link:__

https://github.com/facebook/react/issues


__Mailing list / Chat channel:__

I did not see a link to a mailing list or chat channel on the website.


__Other communication channels:__

There does not appear to be any communication channels on the website.



## Finding info at the project repository and bug/issue tracker.

__URL for instructions for users to download and install the package:__

There is information about downloading and installing in most of the courses linked to by the website.

There are no instructions on the actual website, however through experience React is easy to install.

## Summary assesment

__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__


It seems like it requires some knowledge of React, so I’d suggest that the person contributing (including myself) has some prior React experience




__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__


Yes, it does appear that the maintainers are friendly and active.




__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

I did not see anything to think to the contrary in the comments. It appears to be a friendly community.








__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Yes.








__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

I have not seen an instance of this, however this is a large project and I’m sure the maintainers get a ton of pull requests every day.
