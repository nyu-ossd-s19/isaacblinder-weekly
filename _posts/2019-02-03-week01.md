When I hear the term "open source", I think of a dedicated group of developers building a project for the betterment of the developer community, and the greater public. I recognize that this is not the standard definition of open source, however it cannot be denied that the communal element is crucial.

While I certainly am utilizing open source software in my every-day environment, I cannot name any that I know for a fact to be open-source without further research. I suspect that a lot of the free software installed on my computer is open source, however being free does not in of itself make a software open source.
