# HFOSS
I think the efforts by people to create this form open-source software is definitely a noble venture. I think getting into projects like those is probably similar with regards to their eagerness for contributors, but different in the particular needs such software dictates. I found it interesting that there were such specific needs HFOSS software has, but it definitely makes sense. For example, HFOSS software with a steep learning curve won’t be very useful because the people using it probably don’t have a CS background. Concerning the prestige to contributing to HFOSS projects, I don’t think it is any more or less prestigious, just different. Contributing to a large FOSS project will get you prestige in the programming community, while contributing to a HFOSS project will probably get you more prestige in the humanitarian community.
