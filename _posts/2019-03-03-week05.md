## React project license 
The licence for the React software is the MIT license. The MIT license is very friendly, as it allows users to use the software, even commercially with very little restrictions. It is one of the most commonly used licenses, and is the most frequently used license on Github (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

## Experience downloading React
My experience installing react was very easy. With ‘node’ and the node package manager (npm) installed, i can install react with a single terminal command. I can also create a react app with the ‘create-react-app’ command. I give it a 10/10 for simplicity, however much of the credit belongs to the node package manager.

## Mozilla
I find the Mozilla mission to be interesting and on-theme with our class. A lot of open souce projects are created for the betterment of user-experience and the world at large, and the Mozilla mission fits into that category. It is interesting that you can improve the world and make money in one swing! I also like the ability for people to customize their web experience on Firefox.
