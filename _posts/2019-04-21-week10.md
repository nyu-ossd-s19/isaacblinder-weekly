# Inner Source:
I find the idea of inner source software a little bit obvious, both because of success open source dev. has had in team-oriented projects, and because I’ve been working at a place that uses such techniques for the last year. Although most of my projects haven’t been on large teams at my work, I’ve seen how powerful the tool can be within a company. Version control is extremely valuable no matter how organized the team leaders are, and the common protocall a version control system like git provides helps keep the project structured. When teams get large (in my opinion > 7 people), inner source development is incredibly necessary.

# Team Project:
So far our team has taken great strides, and even had our first pull request merged! I’ve learned how to use TypeScript as a tool as we created Material UI component demos for their website. While this has been a valuable experience, hopefully my team can take on even more challenging issues over the next few weeks.
